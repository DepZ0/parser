For start the PARSER use `npm run start` ( I recommend use `pnpm` );

If all ok - we may see Created folder `parserResult`.
    In this folder we have: folder(the folder name is the current Date), now at this folder
    we can see our folder of PDFs  and JSON file with 'catalogId', 'catalogName', 'linkOfCatalog', 'duringDates';
